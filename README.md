# PRODIGY_ML_01
This project is the first task for the Prodigy InfoTech Machine Learning Internship. It involves building a simple linear regression model to predict house prices based on three key features: square footage (GrLivArea), number of bedrooms (BedroomAbvGr), and number of bathrooms (FullBath). The dataset used is the "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques" dataset from Kaggle, which includes detailed information about residential properties. The model is trained using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and visualized with Matplotlib and Seaborn. The goal is to understand the relationship between these features and house prices, evaluate the model using RÂ² score and Mean Squared Error (MSE), and visualize the results using scatter plots.
